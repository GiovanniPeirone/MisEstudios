for (_statement 1_; _statement 2_; _statement 3_) {  
  _// code block to be executed_  
}

**Statement 1** is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

**Statement 2** defines the condition for executing the code block.

**Statement 3** is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

Ejemplo:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  
  cout << i << "\n";  
}
